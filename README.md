## Bowl Scoring Basics
- One game: 10 frames, score range 0 - 300, each frame has two chances to known down 10 pins

### Strikes
- Knocking down all ten pins with first ball = strike (X)
- Worth 10 plus value of next two rolls
- Minimum = 10 (10 + 0 + 0)
- Maximum = 30 (10 + 10 + 10)
- E.g. 1 strike in first frame, 6 then 2 balls in second frame (10 + 6 + 2)

### Spares
- If two shots to knock down all pins = spare (/)
- Worth 10 plus value of next roll
- Maximum = 20 (10 + 10), spare then strike
- Minimum = 10 (10 + 0), spare then gutter ball

### Open Frames
- If after two shots at least one pin is standing
- Score is total number of pins knocked down
